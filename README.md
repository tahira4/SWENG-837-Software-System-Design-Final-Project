# Unified Academic Support Platform for Online Universities

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project aims to design a unified software solution for online university students to easily access and engage with academic support services such as tutoring, advising, and mentoring.

## ðŸ§© Project Structure
- **Images**: Contains all UML diagrams including Use Case, Domain Model, Component, and Deployment diagrams.
- **Scripts**: Includes any pseudocode, class stubs, or logic used to demonstrate design principles.
- **PowerPoint**: Project presentation slide deck.
- **Word**: Written documents like problem statement, requirements, and detailed design explanation.

## ðŸ§  Design Rationale

### 1. Use Case Diagram
Shows how different users (students, tutors, faculty) interact with the system. Clearly identifies core system services such as booking sessions, managing availability, and giving feedback.

### 2. Domain Model
Defines the main entities: `Student`, `Tutor`, `Session`, `Feedback`, and their relationships. Focused on object-oriented abstraction and separation of concerns.

### 3. Component Diagram
Breaks the system into modules like Authentication, Scheduling, Session Management, and Notification Services. Demonstrates how the system is organized for scalability and maintainability.

### 4. Deployment Diagram
Illustrates the physical deployment of software on servers, cloud environments, and user devices. Includes interaction with third-party tools like video conferencing APIs.

## âœ… Design Highlights
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Emphasized through use of encapsulation, abstraction, and modular class definitions.
- **Design Patterns Used**: 
  - Singleton (for session manager)
  - Factory (for creating user roles)
  - MVC (for organizing UI, logic, and data)
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Addressed through secure role-based access, responsive UI, and scalable cloud-based architecture.

## ðŸ“ˆ Goals
- Increase student access to academic help
- Provide streamlined scheduling and communication tools
- Enable data tracking for continuous improvement
